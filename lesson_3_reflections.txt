When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Work with others.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
I can keep my own test version and it should not be updated automatically.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks - clone in the github
clone - create copied repository from github to a local computer
branches - create new branch
